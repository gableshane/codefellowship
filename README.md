Project:

- [x] Allow users to log in to CodeFellowship and create posts.

- [x] Using the above cheat sheet, add the ability for users to log in to your app.
Upon logging in, users should be taken to a /myprofile route that displays their information.

- [x] Ensure that your homepage, login, and registration routes are accessible to non-logged in users. All other routes should be limited to logged-in users.
Ensure that user registration also logs users into your app automatically.

- [x] Add a Post entity to your app.

- [x] A Post has a body and a createdAt timestamp.

- [x] A logged-in user should be able to create a Post, and a post should belong to the user that created it.
hint: this is a relationship between two pieces of data

- [x] A user’s posts should be visible on their profile page.

- [x] When a user is logged in, the app should display the user’s username on every page (probably in the heading).
